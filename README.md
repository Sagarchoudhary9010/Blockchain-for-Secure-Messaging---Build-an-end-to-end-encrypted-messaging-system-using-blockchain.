# SecureMessaging

## Project Description
SecureMessaging is a decentralized smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables secure and encrypted communication between users. The contract allows users to send and receive encrypted messages, ensuring privacy and security.

## Project Vision
The vision of SecureMessaging is to provide a secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof messaging platform that leverages blockchain technology for confidentiality and integrity. By eliminating central authorities, users have full control over their private communications.

## Future Scope
- **End-to-End Encryption Integration**: Implementing an encryption mechanism on the client-side to enhance security.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Storing messages on decentralized storage solutions like IPFS to reduce on-chain costs.
- **Message Expiry**: Implementing auto-deletion of messages after a specific period to enhance privacy.
- **User Authentication**: Adding multi-signature authentication for accessing messages.
- **Cross-Chain Messaging**: Expanding support to multiple blockchain networks for interoperability.

## Key Features
- **Encrypted Messaging**: Allows users to send and receive encrypted messages securely.
- **Decentralized Communication**: Eliminates intermediaries for secure peer-to-peer messaging.
- **Immutable Records**: Messages are stored on the blockchain, ensuring integrity and preventing tampering.
- **Event Notifications**: Emits an event when a message is sent, enabling real-time notifications.
- **User Privacy**: Messages are only accessible to the intended recipient, maintaining confidentiality.
